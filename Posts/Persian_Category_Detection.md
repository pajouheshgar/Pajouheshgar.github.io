## Persian Category Detection

In summer 2017 I was working on a project in [*Yektanet*](http://yektanet.com/) which is one of the biggest online advertising platforms in Iran.
Result of this project was an __automated system for recognizing text content and categorizing persian web pages__.
We had analyzed our publishers and based on their contents we defined 25 different categories.
These categories are including 
1. Real Estate
2. Car
3. Food
4. Tourism
5. Literature
6. Fitness and Health
7. Fun
8. HouseKeeping and Gardening
9. Sport
10. Animals and Pet
11. Politics and Social
12. Employment
13. Finance
14. Entertainment
15. Information Technology
16. Mobile 
17. Computer
18. Art and Media
19. Fashion
20. Bank and Insurance
21. Internet Service Providers
22. Home Appliances
23. Kids and Teenagers
