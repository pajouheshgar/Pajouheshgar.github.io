## Dimensionality Reduction Part I

Our world (which we live it all days!) is a 3-dimensional world.
It has only 3 spatial axes but there are many other dimensions in our world!
For example one of these dimensions is how much money you got in the bank!
To explain a bit more assume an event happening in the world.
we could specify the location of the event by 3 numbers regarding 3 spatial dimensions.
We could also specify another information about the event, yeah you guessed right, how much money you got in the bank when the event occurred.
As you can guess there is infinite number of these dimensions in our world. 

If we take a look at different phenomena such as a colony of ants we can conclude a fundamental principle.
This principle is existing of __Redundant Units__ which is utilized enormously in engineering like RAID technology and so many others.
__Redundancy__ helps to reduce systemâ€™s failure probability.
As in case of the colony of ants, if there are only few collector and soldier ants (i.e 10), an anteater can destroy the colony easily!
All systems in the world are created from small units which by the failure of a few, the whole system can work properly. 

1. World is made of building blocks we call atoms.
2. Animals are made of building blocks we call cells.
3. Colonies are made of building blocks we call colony members.
4. Countries are made of building blocks we call citizens.
5. Images are made of building blocks we call pixels.
6. Brain is made of building blocks we call neurons.

And so on...

To put it briefly combining many simple units allow us to perform variety of complex tasks, hence a 
modular implementation of the __Word__ will lead to multi-dimensionality!

But the essence of the world is simple(It's my own belief but its a long historical debate!), e.g colony of ants
follows a simple rule and etc.
The goal of dimensionality reduction is to find this essence!
