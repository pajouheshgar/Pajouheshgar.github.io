## Swing 3D API
This library is an API to plot 3D shapes with java, using swing. Source code 
is available on my [github](https://github.com/pajouheshgar/). 
I have implemented Everything from scratch, from Vector2, and Vector3 Classes
to Projection, Camera, and AnimatedCharacter3D classes. This was a part of a bigger 
project I have done during my advanced programming course in university.

## My own implemented game environment using 3D Swing 
These codes are also useful for learning swing and using it to design game scenes.
I implemented a simple game environment using my library. 
This environment has a simple character named Ehsan( 
which is made of simpler parts such as cubes and spheres!) can move in a maze
and open some doors and pick some keys and enter some battles and shops and ... .
I added some animations to the objects to make the environment more attractive
like rotating keys and cubes and openning door animations.
You can also make your own 3D Objects, Animations, and Finally your own game environment.
